Abstract— Goal assignment is a critical challenge in multi-
robot systems. The emergence of large language models (LLMs)
has enabled the use of natural language commands for tackling
goal assignment problems. However, applying LLMs directly to
these tasks presents two limitations: 1) limited accuracy and 2)
excessive decision delays due to their autoregressive nature,
hindering adaptability to unexpected changes. To address these
issues, inspired by dual-process theory, we propose a frame-
work called Collaborative LLMs for dynamic Goal Assignment
(CLGA). Specifically, we leverage LLMs for pre-planning tasks
and invoke an external solver to generate an initial goal assign-
ment solution, ensuring solution accuracy. During execution,
small-scale models enable real-time adjustments to respond to
dynamic environmental changes. This approach integrates the
strengths of slow, precise pre-planning and fast, adaptive online
adjustments, allowing agents to efficiently handle real-world
challenges. Additionally, we introduce a benchmark dataset
for NLP-based goal assignment to advance research in this
domain. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate
that CLGA significantly enhances task execution efficiency and
flexibility in multi-robot systems. The prompt, experimental
videos, and datasets associated with this work are available at

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, multi-robot systems have demonstrated
significant advantages in scenarios such as navigation, lo-
gistics, and communication [1], [2], [3]. Their collaborative
capabilities not only improve task execution efficiency but
also enhance system fault tolerance. A common challenge
in many applications is how to achieve optimal one-to-
one matching that minimizes global costs, such as total
travel distance or task completion time. This is exactly the
problem addressed by the Linear Sum Assignment Problem
(LSAP) [4]. Although traditional optimization algorithms
have been successful in static environments, dynamic distur-
bances in real-world scenarios, such as sudden robot failures
(shown in Figure 1), pose significant challenges to existing
methods in terms of real-time responsiveness. This dynamic
uncertainty places dual demands on goal assignment algo-
rithms: they must both establish precise mathematical models
to handle unstructured information and possess adjustment
capabilities to respond to unforeseen events [5].
Recent breakthroughs in LLMs in complex decision-
making and logical reasoning have opened up new pos-
sibilities for developing goal assignment frameworks that

combine mathematical rigor with flexibility [6]. Studies have
shown that LLMs can decompose human instructions into
subtasks and plan agent behaviors through natural language
interfaces [7]. This ability to map semantics to actions allows
systems to quickly respond to unstructured task require-
ments. However, directly applying LLMs to multi-robot goal
assignment still faces two major technical bottlenecks. First,
the decisions generated by LLMs based on probabilistic
reasoning lack optimality guarantees, which may lead to
suboptimal solutions [8]. Second, the autoregressive reason-
ing mechanism of LLMs causes decision delays, making it
difficult to meet the stringent real-time planning requirements
in applications like search and rescue [9].
To address these challenges, we propose a framework
called Collaborative LLMs for Dynamic Goal Assignment
(CLGA). CLGA can generate assignment solutions based on
natural language problem descriptions of goal assignment.
CLGA integrates a slow thinking module and a fast thinking
module to effectively handle dynamic goal assignment. We
first use the slow thinking module for task pre-planning,
invoking external solvers to generate initial goal assignment
solutions for the multi-robot system to ensure solution accu-
racy. Upon detecting an emergency, the fast thinking module
generates a temporary plan, while the slow thinking module
continues computing the optimized solution. Once the slow
thinking module is ready, the system compares its cost with
that of the fast thinking module and selects the solution with
the lower cost for execution. In the slow thinking module,
a multi-agent collaboration framework is employed, where
each agent is assigned a specific role based on domain
knowledge, and a central commander coordinates the agents’
actions. We employ the Decentralized Hungarian algorithm

as the fast thinking module on the edge to make real-time
adjustments in response to dynamic environmental changes
(other decentralized models can be used as needed) [10].
This approach combines the powerful capabilities of LLMs
with the flexibility of real-time decision-making, improving
the accuracy and flexibility of multi-robot goal assignment.
We also introduce a benchmark dataset that covers a series of
typical multi-robot goal assignment problems. Each sample
in this dataset consists of a textual description of the goal
assignment problem and its corresponding ground truth,
enabling the development and evaluation of LLM-based goal
assignment methods. We conducted extensive evaluations,
including simulations and real-world experiments, and the
results demonstrate that CLGA outperforms existing LLM-
based methods in task execution efficiency and flexibility.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• A hybrid framework integrating slow and fast thinking
modules for dynamic goal assignment.
• An LLM-based multi-agent collaboration system with
role-specific agents and centralized coordination for
modeling and solving optimization problems.
• A benchmark dataset designed for evaluating the multi-
agent goal assignment problem, consisting of different
textual descriptions with varying numbers of agents.
• Validation of the CLGA in both simulations and real-
world experiments, demonstrating improvements.
II. RELATED WORKS
A. LLMs for Planning.
Planning involves organizing actions to solve given prob-
lems, typically by generating a sequence of high-level sym-
bolic operators, and then executing them using low-level con-
trollers [11]. LLM-based task planners can generate solutions
without strict symbol definitions [12], whereas traditional
task planners require predefining operators using domain
knowledge about available actions and constraints [13], [14].
Most LLM-based planning approaches adopt a static plan-
ning strategy, which typically includes zero-shot or few-shot
prediction methods. Zero-shot methods generate solutions
based solely on input commands, while few-shot methods
leverage learning from a limited set of similar examples [15],
[16]. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLMs
often provide suboptimal solutions in task planning [17],
[18]. An alternative approach, adaptive planning, enables
robots to modify their solutions or actions based on feed-
back. This can be done either by generating new solutions
according to environmental observations [19], [20], or by
detecting faults and making corresponding adjustments [21].
However, adaptive planning suffers from significant decision
delays. In the field of multi-agent systems, progress has
been made in enhancing agent cooperation using LLMs [22],
[23]. Unlike previous approaches, our method integrates the
strengths of LLMs and decentralized small-scale models to
address goal assignment in multi-robot systems. This hybrid
strategy overcomes the accuracy and latency challenges of
LLM-only methods, while avoiding the need for each robot
to have its own LLM [22], [23].
B. Goal Assignment
Goal assignment plays a crucial role in various multi-robot
system applications [24], [25], [26]. Existing approaches
can be broadly categorized into optimization-based, market-
based, and learning-based paradigms. Optimization-based
methods typically achieve optimal solutions through decen-
tralized adaptations of algorithms such as the Hungarian
algorithm. To improve efficiency, heuristic approaches, such
as greedy algorithms [10] guaranteeing a 2-approximation
to the optimal solution. Market-based methods are mainly
based on auction mechanisms for goal assignment [27], such
as the Consensus-Based Auction Algorithm [28]. Learning-
based goal assignment has leveraged Graph Neural Networks
to model agent–task relations as bipartite graphs and predict
assignments via supervision [29]. These methods require
users to have a certain level of experience and cannot be
invoked using natural language. Additionally, these methods
can be incorporated into the CLGA framework as the fast
thinking module.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
We have N robots and N goals, denoted by R =
{r1,r2,...,rN} for the set of robots and G = {g1,g2,...,gN}
for the set of goals. Initially, each robot is assigned exactly
one goal. The assignment is denoted by s(t)
ij , where s(t)
ij = 1
indicates that robot ri is assigned to goal g j at step t, and
s(t)
ij = 0 otherwise. The cost of assigning robot ri to goal gj at
time t is denoted by c(t)
ij , which is specific to the application.
At time t = T, two types of emergency may occur:
• Emergency Situation 1 (Faulty Robots). A group of
M robots has malfunctioned and can no longer perform
the assigned tasks. M new robots need to be dispatched
to continue completing the tasks.
• Emergency Situation 2 (New Goals). M new targets
have been added, requiring more robots to be assigned
to these new targets. M new robots need to be dispatched
to continue completing the tasks.
We need to optimize the sum of the initial cost and the cost
after the emergency situation, ensuring that both assignment
schemes satisfy the one-to-one constraint while minimizing
the total cost. This involves:

1. Slow Thinking Module
2. Fast Thinking Module
Fig. 2: CLGA integrates a slow thinking module and a fast thinking module to handle dynamic goal assignment. 1) The
slow thinking module utilizes an Orchestrator to coordinate specialized agents—Interpreter, Identifier, Modeler, Developer,
and Code Reviewer—to process NLP based goal assignment. 2) The fast thinking module, through a decentralized planner,
enables an switching mechanism to respond to emergency situation. Upon detecting emergency, the decentralized planner
generates a temporary plan, while the slow thinking module continues computing an solution. Once the slow thinking module
is ready, CLGA compares its cost with that of the fast thinking module and selects the solution with the lower cost.
IV. METHODOLOGY
This section describes the design of the CLGA framework.
As shown in Figure 2, CLGA comprises two main modules:
the slow thinking module and the fast thinking module. The
slow thinking module handles NLP-based goal assignment;
it takes task descriptions as input and generates an initial
solution. The fast thinking module is responsible for handling
emergencies. When an emergency is detected, the system
activates a decentralized planner to regenerate the solution.
A. Slow Thinking Module: Multi-LLM Collaboration
The slow thinking module primarily comprises multiple
agents, each performing distinct functions, which are coor-
dinated by the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator is responsible
for selecting the appropriate agents to address the problem
at hand. The agents include the Interpreter, the Identifier,
the Modeler, the Developer, and the Code Reviewer. The
problem-solving process is typically divided into two parts.
The first part involves problem modeling, where the natural
language description of the issue is transformed into a
structured operations research model. This step includes
explaining key words, identifying variables, and constructing
the model (as depicted in Figure 2). The second part entails
writing code based on this model to implement a solution.
Each agent’s role and function will be discussed sequentially.
Orchestrator. At each step, the Orchestrator reviews the
ongoing conversation and selects the next agent whether it
be the Interpreter, Identifier, Modeler, Developer or Code
Reviewer. The Orchestrator is responsible for generating and
assigning tasks to the selected agents, such as reviewing
and fixing formulas. The Orchestrator plays a central role
in ensuring smooth communication and task flow among
the agents. The Orchestrator sequentially selects agents to
contribute their expertise. Let the task description be I, and
the set of agents as A = {A1,A2,...,Ak}, where k is the total
number of agents. At each step t, the Orchestrator selects an
agent based on the current state St, where St = (I,Ct). The Ct
is the set of output of previous agents (C0 = /0). The selection
policy is modeled as:
At = Orchestrator(St)
At is the agent selected in step t. Once selected, the agent
contributes an output ct :
ct = At (I,Ct)
Ct+1 = Ct ∪{ct}
The process continues for K steps, and the final outcome is
produced after all the outputs are aggregated.
Interpreter. The Interpreter provides domain-specific
knowledge that enhances problem understanding and for-
mulation. The Interpreter contributes by providing back-
ground knowledge and ensuring that the problem is clearly
understood, enabling the proper identification of variables
and the development of an appropriate solution framework.
Specifically, it explains the key terms that appear in the task
description.
Identifier. The Identifier focuses on identifying and ex-
tracting the relevant variables from the problem description.
These variables represent the decision points in the opti-
mization problem. Leveraging expertise in the domain, this

agent ensures that all critical variables are accurately defined
and extracted, setting the stage for the subsequent modeling
process. The extracted variables are essential for building an
accurate mathematical model of the problem.
Modeler. The Modeler is responsible for constructing the
mathematical optimization model based on the information
extracted by the other agents. This agent utilizes the op-
erational research knowledge inherent in the LLMs itself
to assist in problem solving. Specifically, the Modeler will
output the optimization objectives and constraints in LaTeX
format, which will then be used for code writing.
Developer. The Developer is tasked with writing the code
for the solver. When assigned a task, the Developer begins by
reading the provided task description and the previous com-
ments. The agent will generate code based on the formulas.
If the task is to fix errors identified by the Orchestrator, the
Developer will review and correct the marked expressions.
In our experiments, the programmer uses Python as the
programming language and Gurobi as the solver [30]. CLGA
can support other solvers and programming languages.
Code Reviewer. The Code Reviewer is responsible for
executing the generated code on the data and identifying
any runtime errors that occur. If an error is encountered, the
Code Reviewer flags the variable or clause causing the issue
and provides an error explanation to the Orchestrator. This
information is then used by other agents to fix formulas and
debug the code, ensuring that the final solution is correct.
During the operation of the CLGA, each agent uses a
Chain of Thought for reasoning [31]. Our framework is not
limited to dynamic goal assignment but is versatile enough
to be applied to a broader spectrum of robotic planning tasks.
B. Integration of Fast and Slow Thinking Module
We propose an adaptive switching mechanism for dynamic
goal assignment tasks, integrating a slow thinking module
and a fast thinking module to address emergency situation.
The slow thinking module, based on LLMs, leverages ex-
ternal solvers to generate high-precision global assignment
solutions. The fast thinking module can quickly generate
adjustment solutions in response to emergency, ensuring
rapid reactions. The CLGA adopts the Decentralized Hun-
garian in its implementation [32]. It is worth noting that the
fast thinking module is designed to be interchangeable with
other suitable algorithms, depending on different application
scenarios and requirements.
Initially, the system operates the slow thinking module
to generate and execute an assignment plan Pslow. Upon
detecting an emergency, the fast thinking module is activated
to produce and implement a temporary plan Pfast, while the
slow thinking module concurrently computes an optimized
plan P′
slow. Once P′
slow is ready, the system compares its cost
C(P′
slow) against the cost of the fast thinking module’s current
plan C(Pfast) using a unified cost function. It then selects
the plan with the lower cost for continued execution. If
C(P′
slow) < C(Pfast), the system smoothly transitions to P′
slow.
Otherwise, it maintains Pfast. If Pfast has partially completed
targets, only the unexecuted portions are optimized.
V. EXPERIMENTS
Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to
motion control tasks [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. We adopt an
RL-based controller to govern the agents’ movements [38].
A. Simulation Experiments
The experimental validation in this paper focuses on two
tasks: perimeter defense game and navigation, evaluated in
both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) envi-
ronments. In the perimeter defense game (hereafter referred
to as ’Defense’), defenders aim to intercept intruders, while
the intruders attempt to reach the perimeter without being
captured [39]. The navigation task requires multiple agents
to reach a designated target while avoiding obstacles. Figure
3 illustrates these tasks. We assign intruders to defenders and
goals to navigation agents. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our approach, we simulate the following emergency scenar-
ios during task execution. In both navigation and defense,
there is the concept of a goal.
• Faulty Robots: When a group of M robots malfunctions
and can no longer perform their assigned tasks, M
replacement robots are deployed to assume the respon-
sibilities of the malfunctioning robots.
• New Goals: When M new goals are introduced, M
additional robots are dispatched and assigned to these
newly defined objectives.
In both emergency scenarios, the robot-to-goal assignments
must be dynamically updated to accommodate the changes.
Following the occurrence of an emergency at time t=T, the
CLGA transitions to a local planner, which utilizes the decen-
tralized Hungarian algorithm to manage goal assignments.
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We evaluate the effectiveness of CLGA from two per-
spectives. The first perspective focuses on assessing the
overall performance of the CLGA in response to emergency
situations. The second perspective focuses on evaluating the
accuracy of the initial solutions produced by the CLGA. To
facilitate this assessment, we have developed a benchmark
dataset specifically tailored for evaluating NLP-based goal
assignment methods. We use DeepSeekV2.5 as the default
LLMs and perform five runs.
Benchmark Dataset. The dataset is designed to encom-
pass a variety of task types, ensuring a comprehensive
evaluation across different dimensions and complexities. The
dataset comprises 40 instances, evenly distributed across four
categories: 2D Navigation, 2D Defense, 3D Navigation, and
3D Defense, each containing 10 instances. Every instance
is accompanied by a task description and its corresponding
ground truth assignment. To enhance the diversity and natu-
ralness of these descriptions, we refined them using chatgpt,
ensuring variability in phrasing while maintaining clarity and
relevance to the task. Within each instance, the number of
agents, their initial positions, and target positions (where
applicable) vary, introducing diversity and increasing the
complexity of the scenarios.

A. Overall Performance
Firstly, we compared the effects of using CLGA for
replanning versus not replanning (Standard) in response to
emergency situations. This evaluation employs two primary
metrics: cost and the number of steps required to complete
the tasks. For the defense task, cost is defined as the sum of
Euclidean distances between each defender and its assigned
intruder. For the navigation task, cost represents the sum of
distances from each agent to its designated goal.
As shown in Table I, CLGA consistently outperforms
the standard method in terms of task completion steps,
resulting in significant step reductions across different tasks.
As detailed in Table II, CLGA reduces the cost compared to
the standard method. These results highlight the effectiveness
of the CLGA framework in optimizing task completion and
cost under emergency scenarios, confirming its enhanced
performance in both 2D and 3D environments.

B. Evaluation of the Slow Thinking Module
We evaluate the slow thinking module’s effectiveness in
NLP-based goal assignment by comparing its performance
against various reasoning methods, including PHP [40],
REFF [41], CoT [31], and Classic. The Classic refers to
having the LLMs generate and execute code based on the
description. We employ an automated code evaluation pro-
cess where we generate programming code for each instance
in our dataset. If the generated assignment matches the
ground truth of the instance, we consider the problem to be
successfully solved. The success rate is expressed in terms
of accuracy. We measure the compilation error rate (CE),
which captures the percentage of programs generated that fail
to compile. We also measure the run-time error rate (RE),
which captures errors encountered during execution. We do
not distinguish between navigation and defense tasks, as they
are similar from a modeling perspective. However, there
are differences in dataset format and distance calculations
between 3D and 2D.
As shown in Table III, the CLGA consistently outperforms
the other methods in terms of accuracy, achieving 95% AC
in 2D and 3D environments. In comparison, the PHP method
performs relatively poorly, with a 45% AC in 2D. The
REFF method shows 50% AC in 2D, while the CoT method
achieves 45% accuracy with low compilation errors (10%
CE). It appears that advanced reasoning frameworks such
as REFF, PHP can improve the effectiveness of LLMs in
goal assignment. However, frameworks specifically tailored
for particular tasks, such as CLGA, demonstrate enhanced
performance. The sum of AC, CE, and RE does not equal
100%. This discrepancy arises because the code may execute
correctly yet yield incorrect assignment outcomes.

Different LLM base model. We tested our slow think-
ing module using different LLMs. The comparative results
between various models (DeepSeekV2.5, DeepSeekV3, GPT-
4o-mini, Genmini2.0-pro-exp, Claude3.5-sonnet) are listed in
Table V. The evaluation metrics include AC, CE, and RE.
From the results, we observed that DeepSeekV2.5 achieved
an accuracy of 95% in both 2D and 3D environments.
DeepSeekV3 and Claude3.5-sonnet both reached an accuracy
of 100% in 2D and 3D tasks, with no compilation or run-
time errors. GPT-4o-mini and Genmini2.0-pro-exp showed
acceptable performance. These outcomes suggest that using
better base models can improve the results of the CLGA.
C. Ablation Study
We remove the Orchestrator, Comment, and CoT com-
ponents from the CLGA for an ablation study. Then we can
assess the contributions of individual components to system
performance while maintaining CLGA’s core functionality.
The modifications were structured as follows:
• w/o Orchestrator: In the CLGA, the Orchestrator is re-
sponsible for coordinating the order of agent execution.
Removing the Orchestrator results in CLGA executing
agents randomly, passing the output from one agent to
the next until the final code is generated.
• w/o Comment: In the complete CLGA, each agent re-
ceives the output from the previous agent. Removing the
comment means each agent will independently generate
results based on the task description, and the developer
generates code based on all outputs.
• w/o CoT: In the CLGA, each agent employs a reasoning
method called CoT. The removal of CoT here implies
that all agents within the CLGA will no longer use this
reasoning method. The CoT mentioned here differs from
that referred to in Table III, where it represents a single
agent using CoT to generate allocation schemes.
As shown in Table IV, the complete CLGA framework
achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy rate
of 95%. When CoT reasoning and comments are removed,
there is a slight decrease in accuracy. The removal of the
Orchestrator led to a more significant performance decline,
with accuracy dropping to 75% in 2D and 60% in 3D
environments. Additionally, the CE increased to 10% in 2D,
and the RE rose to 20% in 3D. The notable impact of
removing the Orchestrator is largely due to its role in coordi-
nating the actions of other agents. These results highlight the
importance of each component within the CLGA framework.

D. Real-Robot Experiments
We used e-puck robots to evaluate the performance of
the CLGA framework, including its ability to handle emer-
gency [42]. The robots were deployed in a 2D physical
environment measuring 2m × 2m, with each robot tasked
with achieving a specific objective based on natural language
commands. We simulated two types of emergency situations
previously mentioned. During execution, the CLGA frame-
work effectively combined the slow yet precise pre-planning
of goal assignment using LLMs with the fast, adaptive
adjustments handled by decentralized smaller models. These
real-time adjustments enabled the system to dynamically
respond to emergency, proving the framework’s robustness
in dealing with real-world challenges.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the CLGA framework provides a viable
approach to dynamic multi-robot goal assignment. The in-
tegration of LLMs enables task pre-planning and facilitates
seamless human-machine interaction, while the real-time
adjustments made by smaller models provide the capability
to handle unforeseen events. This paper validates the effec-
tiveness of the proposed CLGA framework through both
simulations and real-world experiments. Furthermore, the
introduction of a multi-robot goal assignment benchmark
dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing research
in this field. Additionally, our framework is not confined to
dynamic goal assignment but can be applied to a broader
range of robotic planning tasks. This work highlights the
potential of the LLMs to address the challenges faced by
multi-robot systems in dynamic environments and offers
directions for future applications.
